# ADR 0005: Detection execution and Operations storage

## Status

Accepted. Extended by [ADR 0014](0014-http-ingestion-type-fidelity-registry.md) for ingestion type fidelity across Proton and DuckDB.

## Context

The roadmap and historical Proton/streaming ADRs converge on a separation between Analytics execution and detection execution. DuckDB is excellent for local analytics and historical investigation. Proton/ClickHouse-compatible streaming infrastructure is the target for scheduled and near-real-time detection execution. Alert evidence must remain immutable while triage state remains mutable.

## Decision

- Timeplus Proton is the target execution engine for NRT and scheduled detections; the Proton HTTP ingest leg must validate registry-derived types rather than independently inferring them from NDJSON.
- DuckDB remains the analytics and historical investigation engine; its lake DDL and append paths must be generated or validated from the same logical type registry as Proton.
- Accepted detections project into executable definitions before deployment/execution.
- Detection runs record execution windows, status, diagnostics, counts, duration, retries, and failures.
- Alert events and alert entities are immutable append-only lake records.
- Incident candidates, candidate links, evidence annotations, triage decisions, and suppression/enrichment workflow state live in a mutable Operations SQLite boundary unless a future ADR changes that store.
- Approved Operations KQL views expose operational read models without making UI components depend on storage internals.

## Consequences

- Existing SQLite alert scaffolding must migrate to the append-only lake model before production v1.
- Alert status must not be represented by mutating raw alert evidence.
- The mediation daemon/worker must handle deduplication, replay, and recovery deterministically.
- Detection parity depends on generated physical schemas and translator policies from the registry so Proton and DuckDB do not disagree on timestamps, durations, IPs, UUIDs, decimals, nulls, nested fields, or large integers.
