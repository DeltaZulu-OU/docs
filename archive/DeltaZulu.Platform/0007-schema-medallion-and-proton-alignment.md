# ADR 0007: Schema medallion and Proton alignment

## Status

Accepted. Supersedes [ADR 0003](0003-schema-medallion-and-provenance.md) where the two conflict. Extended by [ADR 0014](0014-http-ingestion-type-fidelity-registry.md) for HTTP ingestion and logical-type fidelity.

## Context

The existing schema code is medallion-aware: it has Bronze source tables, Silver parser views, Golden approved views, DuckDB schema emission, KQL editor metadata, and Proton detection SQL support. The target architecture needs a stricter contract so raw telemetry stays replayable, agents stay simple, Silver does not explode by event ID, and DuckDB/DuckLake plus Timeplus Proton share one Golden mental model.

## Decision

- **Bronze is the replayable raw-evidence layer.** The target Bronze contract is `RawEventEnvelope v1` persisted as `RawEvent`, including payload, source, timing, sequence, integrity, transport, parser-status, and envelope-version metadata.
- **Agents only collect and forward.** Agents may frame, timestamp, sequence, hash, compress, buffer, and forward raw events. They do not map into Silver, Golden, ASIM, OCSF, detections, or enrichments.
- **Silver is grouped by source family and payload shape.** Windows Security and Sysmon should start as grouped source-family records with promoted common fields plus `EventDataJson`; the platform should not create one Silver table per event ID by default.
- **Golden is DeltaZulu's analyst-facing activity schema.** KQL, dashboards, scheduled detections, incidents, and Proton streaming detections target DeltaZulu-owned PascalCase tables such as `Authentication`, `ProcessActivity`, `NetworkActivity`, `DnsActivity`, `FileActivity`, `RegistryActivity`, and `AlertActivity`.
- **Golden records carry lineage.** Cross-engine Golden definitions must include `EventTime`, `TenantId`, `RawEventId`, `SourceType`, and `ActivityName`; they should also carry `IngestedTime`, `SilverEventId`, `SourceName`, `SourceEventId`, parser identity/version, and optional OCSF lineage where useful.
- **Proton is a streaming projection, not a second lake.** Proton may use short-lived ingestion or staging streams, but detection logic should run against Golden-compatible streams/materialized views and emit alert/incident candidates with lake evidence IDs.
- **Schema definitions are authoritative.** C# schema definitions should drive DuckDB/DuckLake DDL, Proton DDL, KQL metadata, Markdown reference docs, and compatibility validation. ADR 0014 strengthens this into a producer-agnostic logical schema registry that also drives translator type policy while DuckDB/DuckLake and Proton ingest over HTTP.

## Current implementation gap

The current code is a precursor, not the final target:

- Bronze is currently source-family oriented (`windows_sysmon_event`, `windows_security_event`, `dns_server_event`) rather than a single `RawEventEnvelope`/`RawEvent` contract.
- Silver parser contributors are currently event-specific views projected into Golden columns; the target is grouped source-family Silver records followed by separate Golden normalization.
- Golden currently exposes `Dns`, `NetworkSession`, and `ProcessEvent` with fields such as `Timestamp` and `ActionType`; the target uses activity names and required lineage fields.
- Proton support exists for detection SQL/DDL, but Golden-compatible Proton streams should be generated from the same logical schema definitions as lake tables. Current HTTP NDJSON publishers are valid transport adapters, but must validate payloads against the target type-fidelity contract.

## Consequences

- New schema work should add the target contracts in parallel and migrate existing views incrementally; avoid a flag-day rewrite.
- ETW-specific producer envelopes are governed by [ADR 0010](0010-etw-collection-and-replay-boundaries.md) and must map into the same `RawEventEnvelope v1`/`RawEvent` Bronze evidence contract rather than creating a separate ETW lake path.
- Existing `Dns`, `NetworkSession`, and `ProcessEvent` contracts may remain as compatibility aliases during migration, but new content should prefer the target Golden activity names.
- Parser and normalizer code should be split at the Bronze→Silver and Silver→Golden boundary.
- Drift checks should cover DuckDB/DuckLake, Proton, and KQL metadata generation from the shared schema catalog; HTTP payload validation must use the same catalog.
