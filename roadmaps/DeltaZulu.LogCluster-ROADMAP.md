# Roadmap

This roadmap tracks planned work for making DeltaZulu.LogCluster a maintainable parser-suggestion component while preserving the mining core as a reusable LogCluster implementation.

## Status

* **P0 — done.** `DeltaZulu.Parse` exposes the public `ILiblognormParserCatalog` / `LiblognormParserCatalog.Instance` catalog API described below.
* **P1 — done.** `DeltaZulu.Suggester` references `DeltaZulu.Parse` (NuGet package) and `LiblognormSuggestionEngine` is now a thin adapter over `LiblognormParserCatalog.Instance`. The local `LiblognormMotifs` shim has been removed and regression tests prove suggestions come from Parse metadata and full-match validation.
* **P2–P4** remain open.

## Prioritized phases

| Priority | Phase | Goal | Suggested changes | Exit criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 (done) | Parse parser catalog contract | Make `DeltaZulu.Parse` the canonical source for liblognorm parser names, priorities, and whole-sample validators. | Add a public `ILiblognormParserCatalog` in `DeltaZulu.Parse` that exposes parser descriptors, `WordParserName`, `RestParserName`, lookup by parser name, and `IsFullMatch` validation. Keep parser IDs, parser delegates, `Npb`, dispatch details, and extraction internals private. | `DeltaZulu.Parse` publishes or otherwise exposes a consumable catalog API that the suggester can reference without duplicating parser syntax. |
| P1 (done) | Suggester catalog integration | Replace the local motif shim with an adapter over the Parse catalog. | Add `DeltaZulu.Parse` as a project/package reference to `DeltaZulu.Suggester`; update `LiblognormSuggestionEngine` to use `LiblognormParserCatalog.Instance`; remove duplicated regex/IP/date checks once Parse validators cover the supported motifs. | `DeltaZulu.Suggester` no longer defines canonical parser names or validator logic locally; tests prove suggestions come from Parse metadata and full-match validation. |
| P2 | Rule-rendering hardening | Use shared parser metadata consistently while keeping LogCluster mining independent. | Keep `DeltaZulu.LogCluster` dependent only on `IGapSuggestionEngine`; preserve conservative handling for unresolved internal gaps; add regression coverage for fallback-only `rest` and sample-inferable parser selection. | Core mining code remains parser-package agnostic, and rule rendering behavior is covered by tests for specific parsers, fallback parsers, and unresolved gaps. |
| P3 | Packaging and repository workflow | Make the cross-repository dependency repeatable for development and CI. | Package reference to `DeltaZulu.Parse` is in place via `Directory.Packages.props` and `NuGet.config`. Keep restore/build instructions current for package consumers. | A clean checkout can restore, build, and test with the Parse-backed suggester in CI and local development. |
| P4 | Expanded parser suggestions | Broaden supported parser suggestions after the catalog integration is stable. | Review `DeltaZulu.Parse` parser descriptors for additional sample-inferable motifs such as structured parsers; add confidence tests and user-facing warnings for ambiguous motifs. | New parser suggestions are data-driven from the catalog, have regression tests, and preserve human-reviewable output. |

## Proposed Parse catalog shape

The suggester needs a metadata-only public surface from `DeltaZulu.Parse`. It does not need access to `Npb`, parser delegates, field extraction, parser IDs, or PDAG internals.

```csharp
namespace DeltaZulu.Parse;

public enum LiblognormParserSuggestionUse
{
    None,
    InferFromSample,
    FallbackOnly,
}

public sealed record LiblognormParserDescriptor(
    string Name,
    int Priority,
    LiblognormParserSuggestionUse SuggestionUse,
    bool RequiresConfiguration)
{
    public bool CanInferFromSample => SuggestionUse == LiblognormParserSuggestionUse.InferFromSample;

    public bool CanRenderWithoutConfiguration => !RequiresConfiguration;
}

public interface ILiblognormParserCatalog
{
    IReadOnlyList<LiblognormParserDescriptor> Parsers { get; }

    string WordParserName { get; }

    string RestParserName { get; }

    bool TryGetParser(string name, out LiblognormParserDescriptor parser);

    bool IsFullMatch(string parserName, ReadOnlySpan<char> sample);
}
```

`DeltaZulu.Parse` can implement this as a thin public adapter over its internal parser table. `InferFromSample` identifies parsers the suggester may infer from observed gap samples, while `FallbackOnly` covers renderable fallback motifs such as `rest` that should not win sample-based recognition.

## Corrections applied on migration (2026-08-16)

**`LiblognormParserDescriptor` does not exist and will not.** This roadmap
proposes that type and an interface exposing
`IReadOnlyList<LiblognormParserDescriptor>` / `TryGetParser`. `DeltaZulu.Parse`
shipped **`ParserDescriptor`** instead, in `ParserCatalog.cs`. Any work planned
against the proposed name must be re-read against the shipped one.

**Counter widths remain a live defect.** `MaxRecords` and
`TokenizedRecord.Stream` are `long`, while `DiscoverFrequentWords`,
`MiningResult.RecordCount`, `MiningResult.OutlierCount`,
`PatternCandidate.Support`, `GapStatistics.Observations` and
`CandidateScorer.Score` are `int`. Above `int.MaxValue` they wrap, and
`Math.Log(1 + recordCount)` then yields `NaN`. Widening them is scheduled work,
not a proposal.

**Motif removals are more expensive than they look.** Any plan to drop
`v2-iptables` or `cisco-interface-spec` should know that the committed parity
corpus covers them with 15 and 5 cases respectively — 20 cases of upstream
coverage forfeited. An earlier count that read only the JSON rulebase syntax
reported 1 and 0, which made the removal look nearly free.

## Review trigger

**Next review: 2026-11-16.** Migrated to `DeltaZulu-OU/docs` on 2026-08-16 from
its origin repository, which no longer carries a copy.

Review earlier than the date above if any of these happen:

- a Decision this roadmap depends on changes status in `decisions/`;
- a phase named here completes, or is found to have been overtaken;
- a claim in it is contradicted by the code, as several already were.

A roadmap with no review date becomes an archaeological artefact that still reads
as a commitment. That is what this section exists to prevent.
