# Architecture migration roadmap

This roadmap tracks migration to the target topology in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). It replaces earlier extraction-first,
DurableBuffer-first, profile-per-source, and permanent-multiplexer plans.

## Status legend

- **Complete**: target decision/documentation is recorded; no implementation
  claim is implied.
- **Active**: the current implementation focus; its completion evidence has not
  yet been met.
- **Planned**: accepted work not yet implemented.
- **Transitional**: current code intentionally differs while a later phase is
  pending.

## Current baseline

The repository has one multi-targeted `DeltaZulu.Pipeline` assembly that
references `DeltaZulu.DurableBuffer`, `DeltaZulu.Forward`, `DeltaZulu.Parse`
(ADR 0013; renamed from `DeltaZulu.Normalize`), and `DeltaZulu.LocalStream`
through package references. The prior in-repository Parse and LocalStream
placeholder projects have been removed; the PDAG compiler and stream runtime
remain Phase 6-7 and Phase 9 work.
The daemon still runs separate `ProfileBinding`/`ResourcePipeline` work and
uses `ChannelOutputMultiplexer` to serialize concurrent legacy output. Those
are transitional implementation details, not target architecture. Existing
syslog and auditd parsing is also transitional until Parse parity is
established. Agent-to-collector forwarding still speaks FORWARDER
compatibility framing (a `ForwardLogBatch` typed batch, `ForwardLogBatchCodec`-
encoded and carried as a DeltaZulu.Forward RawEnvelope batch); the typed
DeltaZulu.Forward transport's binary framing, handshake, and dedup-window
state machine (ADR 0011/0014, ROADMAP.md Phase 12a) is not yet implemented.

## Current delivery status (2026-07-17)

**We have completed the architectural foundation (Phases 0 and 1) and are now
working on Phase 2: input contracts.** `TextInputRecord`,
`StructuredInputRecord`, and an initial `ExecutionPlanCompiler` now exist as
Phase 2 scaffolds. The next implementation step is to adapt existing inputs
without losing their current source metadata. This establishes
the strict source boundary required before Phase 6 can add `parse.query` and
Phase 7 can compile a unified PDAG.

The following capabilities are deliberately **not** claimed as present yet;
the phase table below and its "implementation notes" section are the
current code/documentation gap inventory.
KqlTools/RealTimeKql alignment is tracked as an intentional local-query lane in
[`REALTIME_TABLE_STREAMING_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](REALTIME_TABLE_STREAMING_GAP_ANALYSIS.md):
DeltaZulu should preserve KqlTools-style queryable table aliases such as
`EtwTcp`, `EtwDns`, and file-stem tables for local streaming queries, while
using `DeltaZulu.Parse` for pattern-based extraction behind raw table bindings.

- Parse is consumed as a package boundary; this repository does not yet wire a
  plaintext parser implementation into the runtime.
- LocalStream is consumed as a package boundary, but this repository does not
  yet wire host, storage, producer, subscription, replay, or commit behavior
  into the daemon runtime.
- The daemon is not yet an execution-plan runtime and still uses per-profile
  `ResourcePipeline` instances, direct DurableBuffer forwarding, and
  `ChannelOutputMultiplexer`.
- The type-contract catalog, generated Proton/DuckDB DDL, and translator
  type tables are accepted target design only; no implementation exists in
  this repository yet. The wire format is MessagePack, not Avro (ADR 0014);
  the collector's internal representation is the catalog-typed record
  itself, not Arrow (ADR 0015). There is no Avro wire schema projection and
  no Arrow in-memory schema projection.
- The typed DeltaZulu.Forward transport's binary framing, handshake, and
  dedup-window state machine (ADR 0011/0014, Phase 12a) and the bespoke
  native Proton sink (ADR 0016; no Kafka-API-compatible intermediate) are
  accepted target design only; current forwarding still speaks FORWARDER
  compatibility framing (a `ForwardLogBatch` typed batch, `ForwardLogBatchCodec`-
  encoded, over DeltaZulu.Forward's RawEnvelope path) and no Proton-leg
  publishing code exists.

Phase 2 work must preserve the legacy behavior through compatibility adapters;
it must not prematurely move structured sources through Parse or replace
the daemon runtime. It must also avoid accidentally erasing the RealTimeKql
authoring model: replacing hardcoded syslog, auditd, auth.log, web-server-log,
and other non-structured log parsers with `DeltaZulu.Parse` changes how raw text
becomes fields, not the KQL table identity users type. Local streaming queries
should still prefer explicit, KqlTools-style table aliases (`EtwTcp`, `EtwDns`,
`AuthLog`, `NginxAccess`, file stems) over generic family tables plus `Source`
predicates when a binding is unambiguous. The
type-contract-catalog architecture recorded in ADR 0010 (wire format per ADR
0014, not Avro; internal representation per ADR 0015, not Arrow) is
accepted target design, but it is not implemented in the current
baseline and must not be implied by Phase 2 input records alone. Parse is
the first production migration priority after the typed input boundary: it
establishes the parsed-event contract that LocalStream will persist. LocalStream
design and contract work may proceed in parallel, but direct DurableBuffer replacement must not make LocalStream
authoritative for legacy profile-specific `SourceEvent` records.

## Ordered migration

| Phase | Status | Objective | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Complete | Align ADRs and authoritative documentation. | Architecture, roadmap, README, and ADRs state one Pipeline, LocalStream boundaries, PDAG, FORWARDER ownership, and no production multiplexer. |
| 1 | Complete | Add Parse/LocalStream and architecture guards. | Pipeline references Parse, LocalStream, and FORWARDER as package dependencies (`DeltaZulu.Pipeline.csproj`); `PipelineAssembly_ReferencesOnlyExternalPipelineDependencies` rejects Agent-layer references and `PipelineAssembly_TransitionalDirectDurableBufferReferenceIsTracked` reports the direct DurableBuffer use in `tests/DeltaZulu.Agent.Tests/ApplicationTests.cs`. Parse and LocalStream are package boundaries rather than in-repository placeholder projects; PDAG and stream-runtime integration remain later phases. |
| 2 | Active | Define strict input contracts and compile validated acquisition plans. | `TextInputRecord` and `StructuredInputRecord` preserve acquisition metadata; resource configuration separates kind, framing, payload format, admission, parser domain, and deterministic acquisition key. The initial `ExecutionPlanCompiler` normalizes and rejects conflicting physical-resource definitions without replacing runtime execution. |
| 2a | Planned | Align local streaming KQL authoring with RealTimeKql table naming. | A platform-neutral table-binding catalog maps concrete aliases such as `EtwTcp`, `EtwDns`, `AuthLog`, `NginxAccess`, and file-stem tables to acquisition plans, schemas, and openable inputs; raw/non-structured bindings carry a `raw` payload type and `DeltaZulu.Parse` patterns produce extracted fields; the local query path passes the resolved alias to Rx.Kql instead of rewriting it to `Source`; `Source` remains only a compatibility alias for legacy profiles. |
| 3 | Planned | Generalize acquisition, framing, and decoding through protocol-specific adapters. | `file`, `fifo`, `syslog-tcp`, `syslog-udp`, and `syslog-relp` adapters emit either structured records or a common `raw` text record with bounded framing and no application parser dependency. FIFO creation/reopen is explicit configuration, not a syslog behavior. |
| 4 | Planned | Add raw-text admission presets. | Syslog, auth.log, audit logs, web-server logs, and arbitrary file/FIFO text inputs share the `raw` payload path; transport-specific validation, decoding, size checks, and rejection metrics run before Parse, while field extraction is owned by `DeltaZulu.Parse` patterns. Valid unknown raw text reaches Parse. |
| 5 | Planned | Move structured sources and FORWARDER payload adapters to structured contracts. | CSV, Windows, and `ForwardLogBatch` sources bypass Parse; RELP protocol handling remains framing/session work and payload type selects text versus structured materialization. |
| 6 | Planned | Add restricted `parse.query` and a Parse compatibility materializer. | Existing `filter.query` profiles continue receiving compatible `SourceEvent` shapes; profile-scoped diagnostics validate topic-tagged parser rules; raw text and parser provenance are retained. |
| 7 | Planned | Build unified Parse PDAG generations. | Parser domains group compatible rules deterministically; each plaintext record traverses one PDAG; recognized, unrecognized, and error outcomes remain explicit. |
| 8 | Planned | Move auditd correlation after Parse. | The assembler consumes parsed fields, maintains bounded incomplete-group state, and retires the hardcoded audit parser in the acquisition adapter. |
| 9 | Planned | Define parsed envelopes, type-contract catalog entries, and implement the LocalStream host. | `ParsedEventEnvelope` has stable identity, materialization state, and catalog-backed logical type metadata; generated sink DDL and translator type tables are derived from one catalog generation (no Avro wire schema and no Arrow in-memory schema; the wire format is MessagePack per ADR 0014 and the internal representation is the catalog-typed record per ADR 0015). One LocalStream host provides append/read/commit/replay for `agent.parsed` and `agent.output`, but legacy DurableBuffer remains the active forwarder until dispatch and ACK semantics are proven. |
| 10 | Planned | Replace profile-centric execution with execution plans. | The planner opens each physical resource once per acquisition key and binds acquisition to parser/materialization/stream plans deterministically; `ProfileBinding` no longer defines a pipeline instance. |
| 11 | Planned | Add coordinated filter dispatch. | Every candidate runs in deterministic order; output append precedes parsed commit; no-candidate, no-match, filter error, and output error remain distinct. |
| 12 | Planned | Migrate forwarding to LocalStream `agent.output` and retire direct DurableBuffer ownership. | The forwarder is an ACK-gated LocalStream subscription with replay; no forwarder-created DurableBuffer host remains Agent-visible. This phase may land with the transitional FORWARDER transport before DeltaZulu.Forward (Phase 12a) replaces it. |
| 12a | Planned | Implement DeltaZulu.Forward (ADR 0011) as the target agent-to-collector transport. | Binary framing (type, txnr, length, flags), typed offer/capability handshake (catalog version, schema fingerprints, compression, dedup-window size), one MessagePack-encoded `ForwardLogBatch` per frame with ack-on-durable-commit, batch UUIDs, collector-side bounded dedup window, and backpressure/window-adjustment frames all exist as an independently tested state machine (retransmit-after-reconnect races, cross-session duplicates, txnr wraparound, half-open detection, window exhaustion, shutdown with unacked frames) per its own harness budget. Today's FORWARDER/RawEnvelope compatibility framing is retired as the primary transport once the typed DeltaZulu.Forward batch protocol is proven; literal RELP may still be added later as a separate rsyslog-world peer input adapter. |
| 13 | Planned | Remove daemon multiplexer. | The daemon does not instantiate `ChannelOutputMultiplexer`; lifecycle uses plan-owned tasks, stream drain policy, and only private publisher serialization where required. |
| 14 | Planned | Remove compatibility plaintext parsers. | Parse-only plaintext parsing has syslog, journal/FIFO, and auditd parity corpora; no transport adapter invokes an application-specific parser. |
| 15 | Planned | Add blindness and end-to-end observability. | Admission, parser, filter, complete-blindness, streams, forwarding, and bounded unknown diagnostics are observable. |
| 16 | Planned | Harden reload and operations. | Parser and filter generations replace atomically; checkpoints, poison policy, retention/storage pressure, graceful drain, and failure injection are covered. |
| 17 | Planned | Archive conflicting operational guidance. | All active examples and commands validate; historical documents are marked superseded. |
| 18 | Planned | Verify sink ingest and replay assumptions. | The bespoke native Proton sink (ADR 0016) is implemented, versioned, and tested against tracked Proton releases; its native-protocol compatibility is verified rather than assumed. Catalog-typed-record-to-DuckDB appender performance is benchmarked against NDJSON at realistic event rates; agent MessagePack spooling/replay ordering and dedup-window sizing are specified and tested; the sink's NRT-path latency and failure-mode budget are measured (ADR 0016 revisit trigger). |
| 19 | Planned | Optimize only with benchmarks. | Before/after evidence preserves parsing, commit, queue, and blindness invariants. |

Phases 2–5 establish the strict source boundary. Phase 2a is the companion
local-query compatibility lane: it deliberately preserves the KqlTools mental
model for stream/table aliases while Phases 6–8 move raw-text materialization
to Parse. Phases 6–8 are the first production migration priority because they
remove parser ownership overlap and stabilize materialization semantics.
LocalStream contract/design work may run
alongside them, but Phase 12 cannot begin until parsed envelopes, execution
plans, coordinated dispatch, and commit-order tests exist. Phases 9–13 are one
coordinated daemon and type-contract migration and must not be represented as
final architecture until completed.

## Acceptance gates

### Parsing and profiles

- Compatible plaintext rules compile into one deterministic PDAG per domain.
- Every rule has exactly one `topic.*` tag; full `event.tags` remains queryable.
- Structured sources bypass Parse; valid unknown plaintext is preserved.
- `parse.query` is optional and separate from Rx.Kql `filter.query`; no profile
  exposes streams, subscriptions, offsets, partitions, generations, or batching.
- A source specification names a transport/acquisition kind separately from
  framing, payload format, admission policy, and Parse parser domain. The
  planner rejects incompatible combinations and conflicting acquisition keys.
- Local streaming KQL exposes deliberate table aliases (`EtwTcp`, `EtwDns`,
  `AuthLog`, `NginxAccess`, file stems) resolved through a table-binding catalog;
  raw/non-structured logs use a common `raw` payload type and Parse patterns for
  extraction, without regressing authoring to accidental `Source`-predicate
  queries.

### Durability and dispatch

- One LocalStream host owns `agent.parsed` and `agent.output` (ADR 0008),
  initially with one partition each and bounded retention.
- The type-contract catalog is the sole type authority for parsed fields and
  generates Proton/DuckDB DDL, translator type mappings, and governed JSON
  projections. There is no generated Avro wire schema (ADR 0014) and no
  generated Arrow in-memory schema (ADR 0015).
- Internal type-bearing transport is MessagePack (a `ForwardLogBatch`, ADR
  0014) to the collector (over DeltaZulu.Forward per ADR 0011 once
  implemented); the collector works directly with catalog-typed records in
  memory, not Arrow (ADR 0015). NDJSON is limited to third-party
  ingress/egress, debug taps, and dead-letter/error envelopes.
- Parsed positions commit only after all output appends succeed or a recorded
  successful zero-output disposition; output positions commit only after a
  forwarding acknowledgement (FORWARDER today; a DeltaZulu.Forward batch ack once
  Phase 12a lands).
- Logical topics remain envelope properties. No `parsed.sshd`-style streams and
  no general-purpose daemon multiplexer are introduced (ADR 0008).

### Runtime and coverage

- A physical resource opens once per deterministic acquisition key.
- Input adapters emit collection facts and payloads only; they never invoke
  application-specific syslog, journal, auth.log, auditd, web-server-log, or
  other non-structured log parsers. Those inputs use the common `raw` payload
  path and rely on `DeltaZulu.Parse` patterns for extraction.
- Parser and filter generations replace atomically and independently.
- Admission rejection, parser no-match, filter no-candidate, filter no-match,
  and operational errors remain distinct. Unknown records never disappear
  silently.
- UTC microsecond event time, explicit duration units, large integer/decimal
  fidelity, UUID/IP/MAC annotations, and null/absent/empty-string semantics are
  tested through both Proton and DuckDB mappings.

## Type-fidelity migration notes

ADR 0010 adds a type-fidelity track to the migration. The type-contract
catalog is producer-agnostic: liblognorm-derived parser output, direct
XML/CSV/JSON converters, native Windows sources, and future structured inputs
all converge on the same catalog. This prevents a later retrofit where field
types are implicitly tied to Parse rules.

NDJSON remains useful as an edge dialect, but it is no longer the target
internal type-bearing transport. Agents spool MessagePack `ForwardLogBatch`
records (ADR 0014); they fail visibly on rejection instead of falling back
to NDJSON. The collector decodes the MessagePack batch once and works
directly with the resulting catalog-typed record — there is no Arrow layer
(ADR 0015) — then fans out to DuckDB and to Proton through a bespoke native
Proton sink (ADR 0016), not a Kafka-API-compatible intermediate. The
sink's compatibility against tracked Proton native-protocol releases, and
DuckDB ingest performance from catalog-typed records versus the Arrow
zero-copy path ADR 0010 originally assumed, are Phase 3b/18
integration-testing questions.

DeltaZulu.Forward (ADR 0011) is the target transport (MessagePack-encoded
`ForwardLogBatch` batches, ADR 0014) between agent and collector, replacing
today's FORWARDER/RawEnvelope compatibility framing once Phase 12a lands;
see ADR 0011 for the framing, handshake, and dedup-window design and ADR
0006 for the narrowed, transitional role FORWARDER retains.

## Open questions

- **Backend query-translator ownership.** ADR 0010's claim that one KQL
  query should translate against Proton and DuckDB from a shared physical
  type catalog has no in-repository translator implementation, and no
  Proton/DuckDB query translator code exists anywhere in this repository's
  source tree. Whether that translator lives in this repository, in a
  separate DeltaZulu server/platform repository, or has not been started
  anywhere is not currently documented. Resolve this ownership question,
  and update this roadmap and ADR 0010 accordingly, before Phase 18/19
  claim KQL/backend answer parity.

## Validation expectations

Run the repository's relevant .NET restore/build/test commands after each phase.
Build both `net10.0` and `net10.0-windows` in CI. Windows source changes also
need Windows-host validation. New topology work requires deterministic replay,
commit-order, reload, and failure-injection coverage before it is called complete.

## Historical guidance

The legacy direct DurableBuffer forwarding path, profile-per-source daemon
execution, hardcoded syslog/auditd/plaintext parsers, and
`ChannelOutputMultiplexer` are retained only as transitional descriptions of the
current baseline. New non-structured log ingestion should use the common `raw`
payload path plus `DeltaZulu.Parse` patterns, not source-specific parser logic
in acquisition adapters. These transitional details are not design options for
new daemon work.

## Phase 3–4, 8, 10, 12, and 13 implementation notes

Concrete anchors so migration work has file-level targets in addition to the
architecture-level objectives above.

**Phase 3–4 — split syslog transport/framing/admission from parsing:** the
current legacy code is `src/DeltaZulu.Pipeline/Inputs/Syslog/TcpSyslogInput.cs`,
`FifoSyslogInput.cs`, and the file-tail syslog inputs, which instantiate
`LightweightSyslogParser`
(`src/DeltaZulu.Pipeline/Inputs/Syslog/LightweightSyslogParser.cs`) and parse
directly inside the input adapter; `TcpSyslogInput` reads newline-delimited
text and does not implement bounded RFC 6587 octet-counted framing. These
phases split transport/framing/admission (size/PRI checks, admission
metrics) from parsing, moving field extraction to `DeltaZulu.Parse` patterns.

**Phase 8 — move auditd correlation after Parse:** the current legacy code is
`src/DeltaZulu.Pipeline/Inputs/Auditd/AuditdFileInput.cs`, which directly uses
`AuditdRecordParser.cs` and `AuditdEventAssembler.cs` inside the input
adapter. This phase moves record parsing to Parse compatibility rules and
multi-record assembly to post-materialization assembly.

**Phase 10 — execution plans replace `ProfileBinding`/`ResourcePipeline`:** the
current legacy code is `src/DeltaZulu.Agent.Runtime/AgentRuntime.cs`
(`RunSingle`/`RunMultiple`/`RunBinding`), `ProfileBinding.cs`, and
`src/DeltaZulu.Pipeline/Core/ResourcePipeline.cs`. `AgentRuntime.RunMultiple`
(`AgentRuntime.cs:109`) is the exact place that currently starts one
`ResourcePipeline` per `ProfileBinding`, built from bindings that
`src/DeltaZulu.Agent.Daemon/Program.cs`'s `CreateBindings` constructs; this
phase replaces that with acquisition/parser/filter plan binding.

**Phase 12 — replace direct DurableBuffer forwarding:** the current
`BufferedForwarderSink` (`src/DeltaZulu.Pipeline/Outputs/Forwarder/BufferedForwarderSink.cs`)
owns the DurableBuffer host, starts the forwarding worker, and drains it
during shutdown. It is not replaced merely by adding LocalStream:
the LocalStream-backed forwarder must subscribe to `agent.output`, replay after
restart, and commit only after a delivery acknowledgement (FORWARDER until Phase
12a). The direct DurableBuffer project reference is removed only after those
behaviors and their failure tests are in place. Phase 12a then replaces the
FORWARDER acknowledgement with a DeltaZulu.Forward batch acknowledgement per ADR
0011; Phase 12 does not require Forward to exist first.

**Phase 13 — remove `ChannelOutputMultiplexer`:** the deletion condition is
`AgentRuntime` no longer starting one `ResourcePipeline` per `ProfileBinding`
(i.e., Phase 10 complete). Until then, `ChannelOutputMultiplexer`
(`src/DeltaZulu.Pipeline/Core/ChannelOutputMultiplexer.cs`) remains required and
should carry a deletion-condition comment referencing this row.
`CompletionTrackingWriter` (`src/DeltaZulu.Pipeline/Core/CompletionTrackingWriter.cs`)
is a separate, smaller concern and may remain for finite CLI/test workflows
after this phase; it is not part of the daemon's target lifecycle (see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md), "Lifecycle and reload"). If `dzagentctl`
or `DeltaZulu.Agent.ProfileWorkbench` still need to serialize concurrent writes
to one console/file writer afterward, introduce a narrowly scoped
`SerializedOutputWriter` (serialize-only; no routing, buffering, or profile
semantics) rather than retaining the multiplexer for that purpose.
Multiplexer/completion-writer unit tests currently live in
`tests/DeltaZulu.Agent.Tests/ApplicationTests.cs` (`ChannelOutputMultiplexer_*`,
`CompletionTrackingWriter_*`); this phase removes only the former test group.

## Review trigger

**Next review: 2026-11-16.** Migrated to `DeltaZulu-OU/docs` on 2026-08-16 from
its origin repository, which no longer carries a copy.

Review earlier than the date above if any of these happen:

- a Decision this roadmap depends on changes status in `decisions/`;
- a phase named here completes, or is found to have been overtaken;
- a claim in it is contradicted by the code, as several already were.

A roadmap with no review date becomes an archaeological artefact that still reads
as a commitment. That is what this section exists to prevent.
